# Description

TODO

## Quickstart

1. Make sure you have the BugNet dataset generated into `../input/bugnet`

2. Run the script and generate the model results

```console
python main.py --model gpt-3.5-turbo
```

The results will be generated in a csv file that is prefixed with the name of
the model (for example "openai-gpt_results.csv").

3. Run Jupyter to see notebook examples

```console
jupyter notebook
```

## About the models

This is still WIP.
