# ChatGPT

The results on the `gpt-3.5-turbo` language model for the `BugNet` dataset.

## Quickstart

1. Make sure you have the BugNet dataset generated into `../input/bugnet`

2. Create an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` with the value of the API Key for OpenAI

```console
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```

3. Run the script and generate the ChatGPT results

```console
python main.py
```

4. Run Jupyter to see notebook examples

```console
jupyter notebook
```
